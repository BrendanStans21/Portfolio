    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project was a boggle clone and used asynchronous programming so that you could have two games going at the same time that would talk to each other.  As each player played they would be updated whenever anyone scored points.  The username would be listed and how many points they scored.  From there final scores were displayed when the game ended.  Each game lasted 60 seconds.  For this project my role was generating the board and calculating and updating the point values with a correct word that hadn't been found yet.  Each cell on the board had a 40% chance of being a vowel, and the board was randomly generated each time the game was played.  To update the score, the word is checked as the player enters the word and my function would then determine the length and decide the point value to be awarded.  I also helped with all general error checking such as incorrect words and entering the same word more than once.</p>
