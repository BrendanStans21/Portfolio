    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Hangman project is built using html and php.  The user is greeted by a login screen where they have the option to login or sign up.  Passwords are hashed with sha 256 algorithm.  Upon passing the login screen they play the game where they have ten lives.  The player can guess a word or a letter.  At the end of the game the player wins a high score table is displayed.  Win or lose the player is allowed to logout or play again.  For this projects the technologies I used were sql database to store logins, scores, and the words for the game.  I learned about session variables and used that to carry information across the different pages.</p>
