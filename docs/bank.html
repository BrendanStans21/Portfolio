    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project was a simple bank app that had at least three different accounts, had an account details/history page that showed all transactions, and allowed you to withdraw, deposit, or transfer money between any of the accounts.  My role in this project was the account history page and error checking.  The new technology we used was razor pages and implementing a database with C#.  The errors we had to check were things like trying to deposit more money than you had, trying to transfer money that you didn't have etc.  There is also a login screen at the beginning where you sign in with your account number or register a new account.</p>
