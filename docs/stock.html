    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Stock game use ajax, asynchronous programming, and using a graph as input were the new technologies learned.  The whole point of the project was it had to all be displayed and updated on one page without refreshing or redirecting the page.  The game began with a screen where you pick a stock you want to play the game with for example AAPL (apple).  From there you are put in a random day in history and play the game for 7 days.  On each day you have the option to buy, sell or hold.  When clicking on buy, you are giving a menu where you can enter how many stocks you would like to buy with the stock price listed for that day.  Entering data will change all three inputs and show how much the total cost will be.  Once you hit submit, and this is the same for the sell option, the day advances and you money and data are updated.  Sell is very similar to buy except you enter how many stocks you would like to sell.  The hold option just advances the day.  My contribution to this project was mostly error checking.  There is a lot of ways to break this program, from trying to buy more stocks than you can afford, selling more stocks than you have, entering stocks that don't exist etc.  Other things I worked on on this project were formatting the values and the right side of the panel (where the buttons are located).</p>
